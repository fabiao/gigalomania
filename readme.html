<p><a name="requirements"></a><b>Requirements</b></p>

<p>Gigalomania should work on any non-ancient Windows, Linux or OS X PC. Touchscreens/tablets are also supported,
this is tested on Windows 10.
(See the <a href="http://www.herzig-net.de/prog/?page=prog-macgiga">Mac OS X homepage</a> for details
on that version.)</p>

<p>For Android, this requires Android 4.0. A resolution of at least 800x480 is recommended.</p>

<p>For Nokia Symbian smartphones, this requires S60 5th edition (Symbian^1) or later (e.g.,
Nokia 5800). For Maemo, this has been tested on the Nokia N900. For Meego, this has been
tested on the Nokia N950.</p>

<p>If the game fails to run, or has problems, please try the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Windows, make sure you have installed the required libraries/DLLs (see Windows download,
  above).</li>
  <li>On Linux (including the Pandora), try running from the command line (from Terminal window, type gigalomania) to see
  if that gives any informative error message.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.</li>
  <!--<li>On Android, on rare occasions Ministro may fail to download the required libraries due to network or server problems - please try again later to see if the problem still persists.</li>-->
  <li>Please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to report any problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>On PC platforms, Gigalomania also supports using the graphics from Mega Lo Mania (from the Amiga version - should be in hard disk format, e.g., Whdload version)
if you have that game. The "data/" folder should be copied into the main gigalomania/ folder, and then rename the "gfx/" folder to something else (e.g., "xgfx/"). 
It's up to you to legally obtain the game if you want this feature!</p>

<p><a name="quickstart"></a><b>Quickstart</b></p>

<p>Gigalomania has built in tutorials - simply select "Tutorial" from the initial menu, select a player, then pick a tutorial (it's recommended to do them in order!). However if you would rather read a guide, here is one for
the first island:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select game type "SINGLE ISLAND".</li>
	<li>Select a player.</li>
	<li>Click "PLAY ISLAND".</li>
	<li>A number (initially '0') will appear; move the mouse over it and increase the number by clicking the right mouse button (or on a touchscreen, touch the number, then use the arrows that appear to increase the number of people).
  This is to select how many people you want to play the island - the more people, the easier it is. In the full game, you have a fixed number of people to use across all the islands, but for this demo you can choose as many as you like. On the first age, try about 15-20 people to begin with, then adjust accordingly for future games if you want the game to be easier or harder. Later ages will require more people.</li>
	<li>Select one of the squares of the island shown in the top left. Each square (or "sector") has different elements in it, which affects what things you can make, and how quickly; some sectors may be better than others. When you click on a square, the game will start.</li>
  <li>
    Screen layout:<ul>
      <li>In the top left corner is a map of the island. The currently displayed sector is highlighted with a grid.
      Coloured boxes in a square represent sectors which are occupied by either you or the computer players. Smaller coloured boxes
      in the corner of a square represent armies that are present in that sector. To the right of the map are
      displayed the player shields. If any armies are in the current sector, then the number of soldiers in each army for each player will
      be displayed next to the shield. Above the shields is a picture of a arrow - clicking left or right button on this
      icon changes the speed of the game (or on a touchscreen, click this icon to cycle through the three rates of time).</li>
      <li>In the main screen area is a depiction of the current sector. This may show buildings that are in the sector,
      along with armies.</li>
      <li>To the left, below the map is the main control panel. Firstly, the name of the island and the age for the
      current sector is displayed. For sectors which you control (i.e., have a tower in), an interface is below that,
      giving you control over things which are done in this sector.</li>
      <li>Most parts of the interface should have popup help text which explains what you can do by pressing which mouse
      buttons (though not on pure touchscreen platforms like Android).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the main control panel to the left, click the lightbulb icon ("VIEW AND ALTER CURRENT DESIGN"). A new panel
  will appear, with three columns of icons. Select one on the right most column, e.g., the rock icon ("DESIGN A ROCK
  WEAPON"). Now some additional icons will appear just below the lightbulb, including an icon of a man, with the number
  "0" below him. Use the right mouse button to click on the man icon, and increase the number (or on a touchscreen,
  click on the man icon, then use the arrows that appear) - this is the number of
  people designing the weapon you have selected. The clock will start counting down.</li>
  <li>When the design is complete, you will be told "Ergonomically terrific" or "The design is completed" at the bottom
  of the screen. Click the lightbulb at the top of the main control panel, to return to the main interface ("RETURN TO
  SECTOR CONTROL"). Then click the shield icon ("VIEW ARMY WEAPON STOCKS AND ASSEMBLE ARMY") to go to the army screen.</li>
  <li>The icon for the weapon you designed will be displayed, with "OK" beneath it to indicate that you can make the
  weapon. Click and hold down the left mouse button to add people armed with this weapon to your army. The total number in
  your army is displayed beneath the shield icon to the lower right.</li>
  <li>The mouse cursor should now have changed to a shield icon. Move the mouse over the map at the top left. Click on
  the map square containing the enemy tower.</li>
  <li>The army will be deployed, and the map will switch to the new sector. Your people will attack the buildings there,
  and eventually destroy them. The AI may deploy soldiers to defend, depending on what weapons they have invented.</li>
  <li>To complete the island successfully, you must destroy all enemy towers and people.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also view some videos:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

    (v0.25, Windows).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YzhuXQXF-o">Playthrough of the first island</a> (v0.22, Nokia N900).
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="controls"></a><b>Controls</b></p>

<p>The game can be entirely controlled with the mouse or touchscreen, though additional keys are: P - [un]pause game; Escape - quit.
There is also an option to enable a one mouse button interface, rather than requiring two mouse buttons - to enable, go to "Options" (from the screen
where you select an Island to play), and click to change to "ONE MOUSE BUTTON UI". This may be preferable for some
users (e.g., on touchpads). (Touchscreen-only platforms like Android don't have this option.)</p>

<p><a name="gametypes"></a><b>Game types</b></p>
 
<p>When you first load the game, you can choose between two game types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tutorial: Leads you through an interactive tutorial to introduce you to the game (note this option isn't available
  if using graphics from Mega Lo Mania).</li>
  <li>Single Island: You can choose to play on any island of any age you like.  Use "NEXT ISLAND" and "NEXT AGE" to
  select the island and age. You always have a large pool of people, from which you can play with as many as you like.
  Essentially this game style treats each Island as an individual game, with no scorekeeping between islands. (This is
  the only form of gameplay available in versions 0.13 and earlier.)</li>
  <li>All Islands: Here you must start on the first age. Each time you win and island, it is removed from the list,
  and you do not play it again; only when every island in an age is completed do you advance to the next age.
  Within each age, you may choose the order in which to play the islands by selecting "NEXT ISLAND". You only have a
  limited amount of people (determined by the difficulty level that you choose on the next screen),
  and receive an additional allocation each age. Be careful not to use them all up too soon!
  The options menu in the main screen also has options for saving and loading games.</li>
</ul>

<p>You then choose which colour player you wish to be. Each player has their own special skill:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Red People</b> - Your unarmed men will be stronger.</li>
  <li><b>Yellow People</b> - Other players will be more likely to agree to form an alliance with you.</li>
  <li><b>Green People</b> - You can build new towers more quickly.</li>
  <li><b>Blue People</b> - Your buildings will be stronger against attack, and take longer to destroy.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="mainmenu"></a><b>Main menu</b></p>

<p>Next you will be shown the main menu. To the top left will be shown an island to play,
identified by the text to the left (e.g., "Alpha of the First Age").</p>

<p>There are ten ages in total: 10000BC, 2000BC, 1AD, 900AD, 1400AD, 1850AD, 1914AD, 1950AD, 1980AD, 2100AD. For
each island you start in a particular age, and can advance up to three ages in the future (eg, if you start in
10000BC  then you can advance until 900AD). Note that different sectors can be in different ages - the age is
a measure of the current level of technology, rather than how much time has passed.</p>

<p>The main menu options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Next Island" - cycle through the islands available to play in this age. In "All Islands"
  playing mode, once you have completed an island, it will no longer be available to play
  (unless you start a new game).</li>
  <li>"Next Age" (available in "Single Island" playing mode only) - Cycles through the ages to
  play.</li>
  <li>"Options" - displays a sub menu as follows:<ul>
    <li>"Continue" - return to the main menu.</li>
    <li>"Music On/Off" - whether in-game music is enabled - click to change this.</li>
    <li>"Sound On/Off" - whether sound effects are enabled - click to change this.</li>
    <li>"One/Two Mouse Button UI" - in two mouse button mode, the left and right mouse buttons
    are required. In one mouse button mode, only the left mouse button is required (e.g., changing
    the number of people is done by left clicking, then clicking on the left/right arrows that
    appear). Useful for touchpads. (Note that using a touchscreen on Windows will always utilise the
    one mouse button method or showing left/right arrows, whatever this option is; and pure
    touchscreen platforms like Android don't have this option.)</li>
    <li>"Disallow/Allow Nukes" - whether to play with nuclear weapons. If disallowed, then nuclear weapons
    and defences are not available (this means that the age 1980 has no weapon or defence associated
    with it).</li>
    <li>"New Game" - restarts the game and returns to main menu.</li>
    <li>"Load Game" (available in "All Islands" playing mode only) - loads a previously saved
    game.</li>
    <li>"Save Game" (available in "All Islands" playing mode only) - saves the game. There are
    10 available slots to save in.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>"Play Island" - start playing the currently displayed island.</li>
  <li>"Online Help" (Windows, Android and Symbian only) - launches the browser to this web page.</li>
  <li>"Quit" - exits the game (not available on Android, instead use the back button).</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="maingame"></a><b>Main game</b></p>

<p>See <a href="#quickstart">Quickstart</a>, above, or play the tutorials for a basic introduction for the game. This
section now explains the game and interface in more depth.</p>

<p>The map of the island is shown in the top left. Click on a square to view that sector. You can also
move armies by right clicking on a square with one of your armies, and then left clicking on the destination
square (not available on touchscreen platforms).</p>

<p>When there are more than two players (including you), you can try forming an alliance by clicking on their
player shield (sometimes you may be asked to join an alliance, too). There must always be at least two opposing
sides (so an alliance with three players is only possible when there are four sides; if a player is wiped out,
this may cause an alliance to break up).</p>

<p>To the left, below the map, is the main control panel which is displayed when viewing one of your sectors. The following
icons are available. Many of these icons take you to a sub-menu when you click - to return to the main menu, click the icon that
appears at the top of the sub-menu (just below the island map):</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Top row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Person icon - displays how many spare people in the tower - this doesn't include people put to work (see below),
    or armies in the current sector outside the tower. Spare people will, left to their own devices, gradually reproduce and
    grow your population.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shield icon - displays the health status of each building. When you are attacked by enemy armies, the health will
    go down, until each building is destroyed! If a building is destroyed, you lose all the men inside that building. If
    the tower is destroyed, you lose control of the sector! Once you have designed/manufactured shields (see below), you
    can use them to repair buildings - click on the shield (the mouse will change to a shield icon - on touchscreens, a shield
    icon will appear in the top right corner), then click on the building you wish to repair. Note that shields for 1400AD onwards
    require a factory to be manufactured first (see below).
  </li>
  <li>
    Defences icon - allows you to deploy defenders. Once you have designed/manufactured defensive weapons (see below),
    you may deploy them to the building turrets (if you haven't, this icon won't be available). Click on the desired defence
    weapon (the mouse will change to a shield icon - on touchscreens, a shield icon will appear in the top right corner), then
    click on a building turret to deploy. You can also return defenders back inside by not clicking on a defensive weapon (or
    clicking again to disable the deployment), and click on a turret that has a defender deployed. Note that defensive weapons for 1400AD onwards
    require a factory to be manufactured first (see below).
  </li>
  <li>
    Armies icon - allows you to deploy armies. One you have designed/manufactured offensive weapons (see below), you may
    deploy them. You can also deploy unarmed men, which are weaker, and can't attack buildings at all (but can help fight enemy
    armies). Click on the icons to add men to the army, then when ready, either click on a map square at the top left, or click
    in the main sector view (to the middle/right of the screen). Note that offensive weapons for 1400AD onwards
    require a factory to be manufactured first (see below). Also note that for offensive weapons for 1400AD onwards, more than one
    person may be required for each weapon you deploy.
  </li>
  <li><b>2nd row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Blueprints icon - once you have designed any shields or weapons (see below), this will allow you to view your designs, and how much
    of each type of <i>element</i> it takes to build one. Elements must be gathered or mined (see below), and you only have a
    limited amout of each element in the sector. Viewing the blueprints of designs allows you to see how much you need to mine
    of each element. Once all the elements are used up, you can trash the design by clicking on the dustbin icon with both mouse
    buttons (or just a standard touch on touchscreen platforms). In some cases, it may be possible to design the invention again, with
    whatever remaining elements you have left.
  </li>
  <li>
    Design (lightbulb or potion) icon - this allows you to design shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons. Each age has one shield,
    defensive weapon and offensive weapon associated with it. Click on what you want
    to design, then click on the person icon to change the number of designers. More designers will mean less time to design it, but
    leaves less people to do other things (including reproducing). Note that designs for 1914AD onwards require a research centre to be built first.
  </li>
  <li>
    Factory icon - designs for 1400AD onwards must be manufactured rather than being created automatically. Use the factory to do this:
    select which design to manufacture, then set the two numbers: the top is the number of factory workers, the number below is the number to
    manufacture. More factory workers make the job go quicker, but leaves less men for other tasks!
  </li>
  <li><b>3rd row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Element icons - Elements are required to design and create shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons. There are various types of
    elements. Gatherables are picked up automatically. From 2000BC onwards, you sector may have an open pit mine (marked by a large hole shown
    in the main sector view), which requires you to assign people to mine those elements. From 900AD onwards you can build a mine, which may show
    more elements that can be mined (again, you need to assign people to mine each element). Each sector has a different set (and amount) of elements,
    which affects which designs you can make. In later ages, you may find you need to mine elements before you can design anything (since designs only
    show if you have enough of the required elements).
  </li>
  <li><b>Bottom row:</b></li>
  <li>
    Building icons:<ul>
      <li>
        From 900AD you can build a mine, which allows the mining of additional elements (in later ages, you may need to build a mine
        before you can design anything).
      </li>
      <li>
        From 1400AD you can build a factory, which allows manufacturing of shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons for age 1400AD
        onwards (see above).
      </li>
      <li>
        From 1850AD you can build a research centre, which is required for designing shields, defensive weapons and offensive weapons for age 1914AD
        onwards.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>During a battle, pressing Quit gives you the options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quit to desktop - this will exit the game altogether immediately, but the state will be saved. When you next run Gigalomania, it will
  automatically resume (on Android, this option isn't available, instead just press the Home button to immediately exit; the state will also
  be saved automatically if you force-quit the app or the device is rebooted).</li>
  <li>Exit battle - this will end the current battle and take you back to the <a href="#mainmenu">main menu</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="armies"></a><b>Armies</b></p>

<p>Once you have deployed your army (see above), you can move them to another sector by right clicking on the main sector view (not on a building)
(for touchscreen platforms, just tap normally) (the mouse icon will change to a shield - for touchscreen platforms, a shield will appear in the top
right corner), then click on the square on the map view in the top left, where you want the army to move to. You can also move armies using only the
map, by right clicking on a square to select an army in that square (non-touchscreen platforms only).</p>

<p>To return an army to a tower in one of your sectors, first move the army to that sector (if not there already). Then select the army by right clicking
on the main sector view (or normal tap for touchscreen platforms), then left click on your tower (the main building with four turrets).</p>

<p>In later ages, you will find maps that have squares not connected (i.e., separated by sea) - in these cases, only air units can move between them.
Air units are available in ages 1914AD, 1950AD and 2100AD.</p>

<p>The offensive weapon corresponding to 1980AD is a nuclear missile, which can be used to destroy any sector completely! This is deployed like a normal
army, but such an army can only contain 1 nuclear missile, and nothing else.</p>

<p>The defensive weapon corresponding to 1980AD is a nuclear defence. This does not defend your sector, but if the sector is nuked, one of these will launch
and nuke the sector from where the nuclear missile came from.</p>

<p>The defensive weapon corresponding to 2100AD is a laser. This defends both against conventional and nuclear attack.</p>

<p>As well as attacking your enemies, an army can build new towers in unclaimed sectors. When your army is in a sector with no other players, a clock will
appear as they build a new tower. Once the tower is built, you have control of the sector just like your first sector. Note that sectors you control behave
fairly independently - e.g., each sector has its own set of designs, elements and so on. Only people and offensive weapons can be transferred between sectors,
by deploying armies.</p>

<p><a name="suspendedanimation"></a><b>Suspended animation</b></p>

<p>When a sector reaches 2100AD (possible in Age 7 onwards), it is possible to place some
of your people in suspended animation, to "save" them. This has no real effect when playing in "Single Island" mode,
but in "All Islands" mode, it contributes to your final score if you complete the game (finish all the islands).</p>

<p><a name="windowedfullscreen"></a><b>Choosing windowed or fullscreen mode</b></p>

<p>Gigalomania runs in fullscreen mode by default on most platforms, but you can in windowed mode by running from the command line with the argument
"windowed". E.g., on Windows, run with:

<pre>gigalomania.exe windowed</pre>

<p>On Windows you can also doubleclick on gigalomania_windowed.bat to run in windowed mode.</p>

<p>On platforms where Gigalomania runs in windowed mode by default, use the command line option "fullscreen" to force fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to Gigalomania, there are various ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Musicians</b> - Some more music would be nice to add to the game (maybe different music for different ages). More sound effects would also be useful to have.</li>
<li><b>Graphics artists</b> - Whilst most of the "placeholder" graphics have now been removed, there's still plenty of room for improvement, so please let me know.</li>
<li><b>Porting</b> - Feel free to port Gigalomania to other platforms - it should be easy to port to any OS that supports SDL. If you send me the files, I can integrate them into the main source. (Please check the Git repository on Sourceforge for the latest version to work with.)</li>
<li><b>Packaging</b> - For Linux I distributed as source, feel free to help out by being a package maintainer for Gigalomania for a particular Linux distribution.</li>

<li><b>Give me a nice rating :)</b> (On Google Play for Android, or other hosting sites...)</li>
<li><b>Videos</b> - videos of the gameplay (e.g., on YouTube) would be useful to have, partly to help raise awareness, and also to act as gameplay tutorials.</li>

FIXED   Game hanged on some Android devices when screen was locked and
        unlocked.
FIXED   AI no longer sends soldiers to build a tower in a sector occupied by an
        ally (which would result in a loop of continually recalling and sending
        out the army).
FIXED   AI no longer keeps mining an element when nothing new could be designed
        anyway (the sector is deemed "used up").
FIXED   Soldier walking speed not in sync with animation.

        now a less useful strategy).
UPDATED Population growth rate now slows from 250-500, rather than stopping
        abruptly.
UPDATED Nuclear weapons now cost 7.5 elements instead of 5.5.
UPDATED Spaceships now require 8 soldiers rather than 10.
UPDATED Improved AI logic when looking for sectors to build new towers: pick
        more randomly, but prefer sectors that already have the AI's soldiers.
UPDATED AI now prefers waiting for population to grow a bit more when
        abandoning a "used up" sector, to avoid leaving weapons behind.

        ages.
UPDATED There are now four difficulty levels.
UPDATED Tweaked some of the elements in islands for better play.
UPDATED Current game state now saved on Android (when app is shutdown by
        Android, or device restarts).

FIXED   Crash when trying to shutdown the sector, if not all buildings have
        been built.
FIXED   If moving army in another sector directly to the player's tower, if
        retreating, some soldiers should be killed.
FIXED   If moving army in another sector directly to the player's tower, land
        soldiers should not be able to cross sea.
FIXED   Layout of shield and defences meant that the 4th shield or defence
        couldn't easily be selected to deploy if you also had men in the
        sector.
FIXED   Problem with accuracy of game time, could vary slightly depending on
        frame rate due to rounding problem.
FIXED   Animation of soldiers walking wasn't quite right.
FIXED   Animation now speeds up when on faster time rate.
FIXED   User account paths with unicode characters now supported on Windows.

ADDED   New button to return to choosing island screen, after clicking to play
        an island.
ADDED   Online help link for Windows (links to this webpage).
UPDATED Now using SDL 2: window can be resized in windowed mode; faster startup
        due to not having to prescale graphics; no longer have to change PC's
        resolution when running in fullscreen mode.
UPDATED Now using SDL 2 for Android instead of Qt: no longer requires Ministro
        app; now properly scales to fullscreen (and takes full advantage of
        devices with FullHD displays or higher); now supports using device's
        volume keys to change volume.
UPDATED Now runs fullscreen by default on most platforms (use "windowed"
        command line argument to run in windowed mode).
UPDATED Improved graphics: unarmed man, caveman, bombs, and minor changes to
        some of the defenders.
UPDATED Faster startup time.

        seem to effect released binary).
FIXED   Stop game from pausing on AROS when mouse moves outside of window.
ADDED   Ports for MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and Open Pandora.
UPDATED When using Mega Lo Mania graphics, they are now smoothed for better
        appearance.

FIXED   In element stocks screen, positioning of number of elements was
        sometimes slightly obscured by the element icon.
ADDED   Ported to Android.
UPDATED Boosted tower strength by 50% (not so easy to destroy, and lasts longer
        on average than other buildings).

        OS X, Linux - Symbian, Maemo and Meego were unaffected).

Version 0.22 (2012/02/10)

FIXED   Fail rather than crashing if unable to find any maps for an age.
FIXED   Don't reset music/sound on/off choice when switching to next age or
        island.
FIXED   Wasn't updating control panel GUI properly when buildings were
        destroyed.

UPDATED Game window is now centred when run in windowed mode.

Version 0.20 (2011/10/31)

FIXED   Assertion failure on startup if resolution less than 640x512 (the game
        will now work at this low resolution, though note the graphics won't
        look that great).
UPDATED Changed height resolution from multiples of 256 to multiples of 240
        (more compatible with typical PC resolutions).
UPDATED Smoother scaling, to improve graphics quality when run at lower
        resolutions (320x240 or 640x480).
UPDATED Windows version now compiled with Visual Studio Express 2010 SP1.
UPDATED Windows version now uses the Visual C++ runtime DLLs, instead of

        including adding a menu shortcut. Also supports make uninstall.
UPDATED Source archive now includes debian/ folder.
UPDATED Now using pre-compiled headers for Windows source.

        mode).

Version 0.18 (2011/07/19)

FIXED   Problem with "building" GUI icon.
FIXED   Clipping with font images.
ADDED   Ported to OS X (by Andreas Herzig).
